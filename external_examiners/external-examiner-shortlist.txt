Émile J.L. Chappin, TU Delft (The basis of my model is based upon his work with EMLab. We had an email exchange with him at the start of my PhD. I was also invited to an interview within his research group, but by then I had already been offered the post at Imperial.)


Many of these authors are embedded within groups of similar interest to ours, so perhaps if they can’t do it themselves, they can put forward somebody that can.
