First, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors Dr Matthew Forshaw and Dr Stephen McGough. Who, without their support, guidance and insight I would have been unable to develop my skills in an academic context. Through their help and encouragements I have been able to exceed my own expectations.

Secondly, I would like to thank my parents and brother for supporting me during this time. Especially my father who has proved a guiding light during the most challenging parts. For example, inspiring my work on how disruption could be modelled with computational methods and pushing me to go further.

Thirdly I would like to thank Sumiré Moncholi for putting up with me during these years and providing daily support and care.

Since joining Newcastle University I have been helped and inspired by the vast range of problems and applications tackled within the School of Computing and the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics. In particular Junyang Wang, George Stamatiadis, Adam Cattermole, Kathryn Garside, Alexander Brown, Michael Dunne-Willows, Ashleigh McLean, Lauren Roberts, Thomas Cooper, Shane Halloran, Jonny Law, Peter Michalák, Saleh Mohamad and Mario Parreno.

I would also like to thank all my friends outside of the department during this time, especially Thomas Smith, Clement Venard, Sam Major, Marta Fernandez, Wenijan Yang, Alessandro Boussalem, Lars Eriksson, Tom Brunt, Owen Jones, Marianne Amor, Kevin Amor and Connor Scott.

Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues at the University of Cambridge's Centre for Science and Policy, for providing a challenging and stimulating environment to undertake an internship: Nicola Buckley, Katie Cohen, Rob Doubleday, Su Ford, Kate McNeil, Lauren Milden, Jackie Ouchikh, Erica Pramauro and Laura Sayer.
