\section{Motivation} %Section - 1.1 

% Grand vision/plan - How did we deal with it?

The impacts of global warming on the earth may have profound effects on land and ocean ecosystems \cite{IPCC2018}. The release of carbon emissions into the atmosphere increases the likelihood of the most severe impacts and increases the likelihood that tipping points are reached, where runaway carbon emissions and average temperature rises are likely. Examples of these tipping points include the irreversible melting of Greenland, and Antarctic ice sheets, which could happen with a rise of 1.5\degree C or 2\degree C \cite{IPCC2018}. A tipping point is an irreversible change in the climate system \cite{IPCC2018}.

Some of the consequences of climate change include increases in mean temperature in most land and ocean regions, hot extremes in most inhabited regions, heavy precipitation in several regions and the possibility of drought in some regions \cite{IPCC2018}. Sea level rise will continue beyond 2100 even if global warming is limited to 1.5\degree C \cite{IPCC2018}. Land-based impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems include species loss and extinction \cite{IPCC2018}. These are projected to be lower at 1.5\degree C of global warming compare to 2\degree C \cite{IPCC2018}. Limiting global warming to 1.5\degree C compared to 2\degree C is projected to lower the impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems and enable that more of their services are available to humans \cite{IPCC2018}.

A study by Cook \textit{et al.} demonstrated that 97\% of scientific literature concurred that recent global warming was anthropogenic \cite{Cook2013}. Limiting global warming requires limiting the total cumulative global anthropogenic emissions of \ce{CO2} \cite{Masson-Delmotte2018}. 

Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, however, have significantly increased since 1900 \cite{boden2017global}.    Fossil-fuel based electricity generation sources such as coal and natural gas currently provide 65\% of global electricity \cite{BP2018}. Low-carbon sources such as solar, wind, hydro and nuclear provide 35\% \cite{BP2018}. 

Global energy consumption, however, has an even higher proportion of fossil-fuel-based electricity generation \cite{BPReview}. Oil accounts for 34\% of global energy consumption, coal accounts for 27\%, natural gas accounts for 24\%, hydro and nuclear account for 7\% and 4\% respectively, with renewables slightly behind at 4\% \cite{BP2018}. 

It can be seen, therefore, that a transition to a low-carbon electricity supply is not enough to prevent the impacts of climate change. A low-carbon electricity supply is one which releases a lower amount of carbon dioxide over its lifetime than the current, fossil-fuel based system. A transition from fossil-fuel-powered transport and heating to electricity must also occur to halt the emissions of \ce{CO2}. This would lead to a significant increase in electricity demand, a move towards \gls{ires}, such as wind and solar, and storage to fill the gaps in supply when the wind is not blowing or at night, when solar irradiance is too low. 

However, such a transition needs to be performed in a gradual and non-disruptive manner. This ensures that there are no electricity shortages or power cuts that would cause damage to businesses, consumers and the economy. Due to the large uncertainties and difficult choices related to energy and environment policy, as well as energy technology investment, quantitative analysis can be used in the form of models \cite{DeCarolis2012}. These models can provide an intuition and outlook on the consequences of certain decisions on the energy market.

These models can be used to assess scenarios under different variants of government policy, future electricity generation costs and energy demand. These energy modelling tools aim to mimic the behaviour of energy systems through different sets of equations and data sets to determine the energy interactions between different actors and the economy \cite{Machado2019}.

There are limited options to fully understand electricity systems, especially when forecasting into the future. Quantitative energy models are one of these options. The others being through the use of qualitative methods or human intuition based upon prior understanding. Therefore, it is important to state that quantitative models are a single method of understanding these electricity systems and should not be relied upon in isolation. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to fully validate these models. 

One method that could be used to validate electricity models is to undertake a retrospective analysis. That is, we choose a projection from a model 20 years ago, for example, and see how well they performed. However, this is not a perfect solution. Energy models are useful for the time in which they are used, and provide scenarios; not forecasts. That is, a single forecast may be accurate, but human decisions, informed by this model, changed the course of history. Another method to validate a model is to compare model outputs with other models in the field. However, it is possible that all of these models are incorrect. Part of the work presented in this thesis challenges this problem, by using a 5-year cross-validation period, which tests the underlying dynamics of the electricity system model, instead of the point forecasts.

With the increase in decentralised energy markets and renewable energy, a paradigm shift is required from large centralised models with yearly time-steps to models based upon many actors and high-resolution time steps \cite{Pfenninger2014b, Ringkjob2018}. For this purpose, in this PhD, we have developed a generalisable long-term agent-based simulation of decentralised electricity markets with hourly time steps. Using this \gls{ABM}, we have used various machine learning and statistical models to assess what may happen in the future, what the optimal carbon tax strategies could be, and how to prevent market power within a decentralised electricity market. In addition, we have explored the impact of poor forecasting models on the utilisation and investment of the electricity mix. 

Much of the work of this PhD focuses on the electricity market in the United Kingdom. However, the techniques extend to decentralised electricity markets around the world with similar characteristics. 









\section{Research questions}


In order to understand how the transition to a low-carbon energy supply can be optimised, understood and modelled, a number of research questions must be investigated:

\begin{itemize}
	
	
	\item \textbf{Electricity market modelling.} Traditional electricity market models mimic the behaviour of centralised actors with perfect foresight and information. Other models which model actors as having imperfect foresight and information lack the ability to model multiple time-steps over a long time horizon. In addition, the generalisability of such a model is critical, to enable policymakers from around the world to utilise a common model and approach. In Chapter \ref{chapter:elecsim}, a novel open-source agent-based model is presented which challenges these problems.
	
	\item \textbf{Modelling the variability of intermittent renewable energy supplies.} Intermittent renewable energy can produce electricity at both maximum capacity and at zero capacity within the same hour period. It, therefore, becomes important to model these variations in power output over a long-term horizon. Otherwise, the model may overestimate the production of energy from renewables and underestimate the variability of such technologies. This is achieved in Chapter \ref{chapter:elecsim}.
	
	\item \textbf{Validating the accuracy of electricity market models.} Whilst long-term energy models can provide quantitative advice to experts, policymakers and stakeholders, the veracity of these models are rarely validated. The validation of long-term electricity models can highlight problems with the dynamics of the model, important components, and provide confidence in the outputs. Here, an approach is presented to provide confidence in such outputs in Chapter \ref{chapter:elecsim}.
	
	
	\item \textbf{Understanding the long-term impact of poor forecasts on electricity markets.} Forecasting of electricity demand within electricity markets is critical. The settlement of markets occurs prior to the time in which the demand must be supplied. However, the long-term effect on the markets of poor forecasts has not been investigated. Chapter \ref{chapter:demand}
	
	\item \textbf{Finding optimal strategies for decision makers.} Setting carbon taxes has been proposed as a solution to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. However, the impact of such carbon taxes are unknown, as are the optimal strategies. Such a problem can be solved using optimisation based techniques. Here, a solution to finding optimal strategies is presented in Chapter \ref{chapter:carbon}.
	
	\item \textbf{Limiting the impact of collusion and market power.} It is known that oligopolies have a negative effect on markets for consumers. However, what has been explored to a lesser degree, is the proportion of capacity that \gls{GenCo} must own before they have market power. In addition, what would the effect be of a market cap on such electricity markets? Would a market cap reduce the ability for \acrfull{gencos} to inflate electricity prices artificially? Chapter \ref{chapter:reinforcement} investigates this issue.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

Primarily, in this work, simulation is used as a tool to better understand and make projections for electricity markets. Specifically, in this thesis, the agent-based modelling paradigm is used. This enables us to model generator companies as individual agents, with heterogeneous strategies and characteristics. These agents have access to imperfect information and imperfect foresight. This methodology differentiates us from the traditional centralised optimisation approach.

Machine learning and statistical techniques are used to make short-term forecasts of electricity demand. We use both deep learning, offline learning and \gls{onlinelearning} to further improve our methods. Online learning is a machine learning approach which utilises new data to update model weights, and does not require the model to be completely retrained, which is the case for offline learning. In comparison, deep learning utilises neural networks with many different layers. 

Once our simulation model is built, we are able to answer different questions using several approaches. For example, we perturb the exogenous electricity demand by the error distribution generated by the aforementioned electricity demand forecasting methods. This provides an insight into how small errors can have large impacts on the long-term electricity markets in terms of both investments made and generator utilisation.

Multi-objective genetic algorithms are used to explore carbon tax policies which will reduce both carbon emissions and average electricity price. We find that we are able to achieve both of these goals by setting a median carbon tax of ${\sim}$\textsterling200.

Finally, we explore the ability for deep reinforcement learning to make strategic bidding decisions within a day-ahead electricity market. This work enables us to see the proportion of capacity that must be controlled to artificially inflate the electricity price in the market using \gls{marketpower}.

	This paper expands on the work carried out in \cite{Kell2018a}. However, instead of predicting 30 minutes ahead, electricity demand over the next day is predicted, over a 24-hour horizon. To improve results, online learning is used, which is able to update the parameters of the models as new data points become available. The results are significantly improved using this method. Finally, the errors of these predictions are taken and the long-term effects of these are shown on the electricity market using the ElecSim models, both in terms of generator utilisation and long-term investment decisions.
