% Grand vision/plan - How did we deal with it?

The impacts of global warming on the earth may have profound effects on land and ocean ecosystems \cite{IPCC2018}. The release of carbon emissions into the atmosphere increases the likelihood of the most severe of impacts, and increase the likelihood that tipping points are reached, where runaway carbon emissions, and average temperature rises are likely. A tipping point is an irreversible change in the climate system. Examples include the irreversible melting of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which could happen with a rise of 1.5\degree C or 2\degree C. 

Some of the impacts include increases in mean temperature in most land and ocean regions, hot extremes in most inhabited regions, heavy precipitation in several regions and the probability of drought in some regions \cite{IPCC2018}. Sea level rise will continue beyond 2100 even if global warming is limited to 1.5\degree C. Land based impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems include species loss and extinction. These are projected to be lower at 1.5\degree C of global warming compare to 2\degree C. Limiting global warming to 1.5\degree C compared to 2\degree C is projected to lower the impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems and enable that more of their services are available to humans \cite{IPCC2018}.

A study by Cook \textit{et al.} demonstrated that 97\% of scientific literature concurred that recent global warming was anthropogenic \cite{Cook2013}. Limiting global warming requires limiting the total cumulative global anthropogenic emissions of \ce{CO2} \cite{Masson-Delmotte2018}. 

Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, however, have significantly increased since 1900 \cite{boden2017global}.    Fossil-fuel based electricity generation sources such as coal and natural gas currently provide 65\% of global electricity. Low-carbon sources such as solar, wind, hydro and nuclear provide 35\% \cite{BP2018}. 

Global energy consumption, however, has an even higher proportion of fossil-fuel based electricity generation. Oil accounts for 34\% of global energy consumption, coal accounts for 27\%, natural gas accounts for 24\%, hydro and nuclear account for 7\% and 4\% respectively, with renewables slightly behind at 4\% \cite{BPReview}. 

It can be seen, therefore, that a transition to a low-carbon electricity supply is not enough. A transition from fossil-fuel powered transport and heating to electricity must occur to halt the emissions of \ce{CO2}. This would require a significant increase in electricity demand, a move towards intermittent renewable energy supplies, such as wind and solar, and storage to fill the gaps in supply when the wind is not blowing or the sun is hidden by clouds. 

However, such a transition needs to be performed in a gradual and non-disruptive manner. This ensures that there are no electricity shortages or power cuts that would cause damage to businesses, consumers and the economy. Due to the large uncertainties and difficult choices related to energy and environment policy, as well as energy technology investment, quantitative analysis can be used in the form of models \cite{DeCarolis2012}. These models can provide an intuition and outlook on the consequences of certain decisions on the energy market.

These models can be used to assess scenarios under different variants of government policy, future electricity generation costs and energy demand. These energy modelling tools aim to mimic the behaviour of energy systems through different sets of equations and data sets to determine the energy interactions between different actors and the economy \cite{Machado2019}.

With the increase in decentralised energy markets and renewable energy, a paradigm shift is required from large centralised models with yearly time-steps to models based upon many actors and high resolution time steps \cite{Ringkjob2018, Pfenninger2014b}. For this purpose, in this PhD, I have developed a generalisable long-term agent-based simulation of decentralised electricity markets with hourly time steps. Using this agent-based model, I have used various machine learning and statistical models to assess what may happen in the future, what the optimal carbon tax strategies could be, and how to prevent market power within a decentralised electricity market. In addition, I have explored the impact of poor forecasting models on the utilisation and investment of the electricity mix. 

Much of the work of this PhD focuses on the electricity market in the United Kingdom. However the techniques extend to  decentralized electricity markets with similar characteristics. 









\section{Research questions}


In order to understand how the transition to a low-carbon energy supply can be optimised, understood and modelled a number of different research questions must be investigated:

\begin{itemize}


	\item \textbf{Electricity market modelling} Current electricity market models model centralised actors with perfect foresight and information. Other models which model actors as having imperfect foresight and information lack the ability to model multiple time-steps over a long time horizon. In addition, the generalisability of such a model is critical, to enable policy makers from around the world to utilise a common model and approach.

	\item \textbf{Modelling the variability of intermittent renewable energy supplies} Intermittent renewable energy can produce electricity at both maximum capacity and at a capacity of zero within the same hour period. It, therefore, becomes important to model these variations in power output over a long-term horizon. Otherwise, the model may overestimate the production of energy from renewables, and underestimate the variability of such technologies.

	\item \textbf{Validating the accuracy of electricity market models} Whilst long-term energy models can provide quantitative advice to experts, policy makers and stakeholders, the veracity of these models are rarely validated. The validation of long-term electricity models can highlight problems with the dynamics of the model, important components, and provide confidence in the outputs. 


	\item \textbf{Understanding the long-term impact of poor forecasts on electricity markets} Forecasting of electricity demand within electricity markets is critical. The settlement of markets occurs prior to the time in which the demand must be supplied. However, the long-term effect on the markets of poor forecasts has not been investigated.

	\item \textbf{Finding optimal strategies for decision makers} Setting carbon taxes has been proposed as a solution to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. However, the impact of such carbon taxes are unknown, as are the optimal strategies. Such a problem can be solved using optimisation based techniques.

	\item \textbf{Limiting the impact of collusion and market power} It is known that oligopolies have a negative effect on markets for consumers. However, what has been explored to a lesser degree, is the proportion of capacity that generator companies must own before they have market power. In addition, what would the effect be of a market cap on such electricity markets? 

\end{itemize}

	In this paper, we trial different carbon tax strategies using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. We aim to minimise both electricity price and carbon emissions. We find that we are able to achieve both of these goals through different carbon tax strategies.
